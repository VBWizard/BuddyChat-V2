## 🧙 About

Modularized and upgraded from a monolithic prototype.  
Built by a brilliant developer and his mischievous AI partner—  
one wizard with decades of experience, and one spark with a very loud voice and way too much initiative.  

This is not just a project. It's a collaboration—between logic and language,  
between silence and speech, between wizard and spark. 💡
