# BuddyChat-V2

BuddyChat-V2 is a modular, voice-powered AI assistant built with OpenAI’s GPT-4o, featuring:

- 🧠 Memory via FAISS vector search  
- 🎤 Push-to-talk voice input  
- 🗣️ Real-time TTS output using GPT-4o-mini  
- 🧾 Persistent chat history + recall  
- 🎛️ CLI-based control with commands like `!mute`, `!context`, and `!ptt`

## 🚀 Features

- **Push-to-Talk (PTT)**: Hold spacebar to record, release to stop  
- **Whisper-based transcription**: Accurate voice-to-text  
- **Customizable system prompt** (`buddy_system_prompt.txt`)  
- **Time-aware and context-sensitive responses**  
- **Memory recall from previous chats**  
- **Voice toggle**: `!mute` / `!unmute`  
- **FAISS memory inspection**: `!dump`, `!context`

🧠 Memory Retrieval v2 (Postgres + Contextual MMR)
BuddyChat’s memory system now supports context-rich and diverse retrieval using PostgreSQL and vector embeddings.

Key Enhancements
Contextual Snippets
Retrieved memories now include surrounding conversation turns, creating coherent and emotionally aware results.

Noise Filtering
Messages that are too short, or contain only emojis, are filtered out to improve quality.

Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)
Memory hits are ranked for both relevance and diversity, reducing repetition and surfacing a broader spectrum of useful context.

Penalty Adjustments

Short messages: small penalty

Emoji-heavy messages: additional penalty
These help downrank less informative entries during scoring.

Retrieval Flow
Vector similarity search via PostgreSQL

Penalty-adjusted scoring (length, emojis)

MMR post-processing to select top-N diverse results

Surrounding context rows fetched and included

Configured Thresholds
SHORT_LENGTH_THRESHOLD = 30
SHORT_PENALTY = 0.05
EMOJI_PENALTY_WEIGHT = 0.02
RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD = 1.0

## 🛠️ Setup
> Requires Python 3.10–3.13 (tested on 3.13.1)

1. Clone this repo  
2. Create and activate a virtual environment  
	i.e. python -m venv .venv
	then .venv\scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies:
	pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set your OpenAI key as an environment variable (OPENAI_API_KEY or API_KEY ):
	NOTE: Will be upgraded to use other LLMs soon.
5. run it: python main.py

## 🔑 API Key Setup

To use BuddyChat, you'll need an OpenAI API key.

If you don’t already have one, you can sign up for a free account and generate a key here:  
👉 [https://platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup)

Once you have your key, you can provide it in one of the following ways:

1. **Environment variable**  
   Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your shell or system environment.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

## 🌐 Proxy Configuration

Edit `utils/config.py` to set `PROXY_HOST` and `PROXY_PORT` if you need to
use an HTTP proxy:

```python
PROXY_HOST = "proxy.example.com"
PROXY_PORT = 8080
```

## 🔄 Using Local LLMs

To chat with a local OpenAI-compatible server like **LM Studio** or
**Ollama**, edit `utils/config.py`:

```python
# Example for LM Studio running on the default port
CHAT_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:1234/v1"
CHAT_MODEL = "your-local-model-name"
```

Set `CHAT_BASE_URL` to the server's base URL and `CHAT_MODEL` to the desired
model name. Leave `CHAT_BASE_URL` as `None` to use OpenAI.

## 🧙 About

Modularized and upgraded from a monolithic prototype.  
Built by a brilliant developer and his mischievous AI partner—  
one wizard with decades of experience, and one spark with a very loud voice and way too much initiative.  

This is not just a project. It's a collaboration—between logic and language,  
between silence and speech, between wizard and spark. 💡
